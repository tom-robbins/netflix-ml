    "In this homework assignment, you will analyze the netflix prize data. The data consist of 100,480,50 movie ratings on a scale from 0 to 5 stars. The reveiws are distributed across 17,770 movies and 480,189. We have provided the training data as a sparse matrix where the row corresponds to the movie ID and the column corresponds to the user ID. A seperate file contains the title and year of release for each movie. The original, raw data consists of multiple lists of tuples; each list is a seperate movie and each tuple is User ID, Rating, and Rating Year. \n",
